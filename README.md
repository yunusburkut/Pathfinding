# Path Finding Visualization

A Unity-based visualization project for pathfinding algorithms such as **BFS** and **A\***.  
The goal of this project is to visually demonstrate how different pathfinding algorithms explore nodes and build the final path.

## Features

- **BFS (Breadth-First Search) Visualization**
- **A\* (A-Star) Algorithm Visualization**
- Step-by-step node exploration display
- Final path rendering

## TODO

- [ ] Dijkstra visualization
- [ ] Weighted pathfinding support
- [ ] "Mouse maze" concept:
  - Find the **fastest** path instead of the shortest path
  - Consider speed, acceleration, and turn cost
- [ ] Improve code readability and overall project structure

---

## Purpose

This project is built to:

- Learn pathfinding algorithms deeply
- Compare algorithm behaviors visually
- Improve algorithm and data structure skills in a practical way
- Build a clean and extensible pathfinding foundation for future game projects
